                <p> Bulldozers come in and clear the land next to homes,
                    mowing down trees and wildlife.</p>
                <p>A single well pad requires roughly one acre of land. State regulations have historically allowed
                    fracking operations to take place as close as 500ft from homes.</p>

                <p>The rig goes up, as trucks drive in and out of the site.
                </p>
                <p>Each fracked well requires thousands of truck trips to carry water, sand and chemicals; these are
                    the proprietary (or secret) ingredients that make up fracking fluid.</p>

                <p>Dozens of metal shipping crates pop up along the edges
                    of the well pad.</p>
                <p>A single well can require between 1.5-16 million gallons of water per frack. Water can come from
                    municipal sources, reservoirs, rivers, or lakes. Many of the chemicals used in the fracking
                    process are known carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.</p>

                <p>Well bore is drilled down through underground layers,
                    and water table. Well bore eventually turns horizontal, then goes back up; steel casing and
                    cement are placed into the bore
                    hole.</p>
                <p>A well bore is drilled between 1-2 miles below the surface, then turned horizontally to reach
                    tiny bubbles of gas trapped within the rock. A steel pipe and cement casing are inserted in an
                    attempt to prevent water and soil contamination.</p>
